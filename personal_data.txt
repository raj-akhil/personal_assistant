WORK EXPERIENCE

1. **NHS Ipswich, UK – Senior Data Conversion Engineer (Sep 2023 – Present)**

- Responsible for **leading data migration from legacy EHR systems** like ChemoCare, Medisite, and Evolve into the EPIC Electronic Patient Record (EPR).
- **Expertly used HL7 protocol and the Rhapsody Integration Engine** to ensure clean, structured, and standardized messaging between healthcare systems during ETL.
- Designed and executed **high-quality, error-free data pipelines** by validating schemas, handling data quality checks, managing type mismatches, and aligning with EPIC's strict data models.
- Ran **interactive validation workshops** with nurses, data managers, and consultants to reconcile clinical data with system constraints — ensuring semantic and structural accuracy.
- Identified edge cases like abnormal lab value mappings or ambiguous date conversions and developed **automated detection scripts** to reduce manual review workload.
- Interfaced regularly with **cross-functional NHS teams** (IT leads, EPIC experts, Trust data controllers) and explained complex data transformations to non-technical stakeholders.
- Leveraged both **SQL scripts and Python** for preprocessing, and **Rhapsody's orchestration logic** for real-time message delivery.
- Delivered modules on patient demographics, treatment history, and oncology protocols with complete audit trails.
- These efforts contributed to **£1B NHS savings**, attributed to increased operational efficiency and reduced patient risk due to data inconsistencies.
